# Pokedex

This small app shows you an array of Pok√©mons, including their name, types and a picture, and you can filter the Pok√©mons by name. When you click on one of the Pok√©mons, it shows a detail card (built with React Router) with more information about the Pok√©mon.

This project was developed as a part of the online training for [Adalab](https://adalab.es/) It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and the data comes from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).
